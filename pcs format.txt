.pcs Format:

A .pcs file represents a set of pieces, with each line representing a different piece.
Each piece is required to have a name (in the name area) and a full standard area (even if it's just full of 0s!)
For more specialized behaviour, the standard area can be followed by a /, and then followed with an override state.
This override state is simply an actual game logic state written out, which will be forced on the piece when spawned.
Since it's the exact same format as the in-game logic states, some areas are unused in .pcs, but for ease of processing, all
parts are required to be filled in some way (even if all 0s, indicating default state) if the override is used

nnnnn: MCCSSZZDDDDDDDDD...DDD/XXXYYYRRVOO

-NAME AREA-
nnnn: Piece name (can be any length)

-STANDARD AREA-
M: Mode Switch
    0 - Default Mode
    1 - Colored Mode (Changes Data section to parse values 0-9 then a-z to specify block-by-block color/texture)
CC: Piece Color/Texture (default mode)
    0 - Blank
    1 - Red 
    2 - Green 
    3 - Blue 
    4 - Yellow 
    5 - Purple 
    6 - Cyan 
    7 - Orange 
SS - Number of unique rotation states (Almost always 1, 2, or 4)
ZZ - Width/Height of Bounding Square (Only one number since it's a square)
DDDD... - Data section, contains piece data (varies in length according to state count and size)

-OVERRIDE AREA (NOT required)-
XXX: Spawn X-coordinate
YYY: Spawn Y-coordinate
RR: Spawn rotation state
V: Mode override (irrelvant for .pcs; should always be 0)
OO: Color override (irrelevant for .pcs; should always be 00)


given x, y, r (rotation state) coordinates, all starting at 0:
always: add 7 (due to header at start of string)
for each x: add 1
for each y: add piece.size
for each r: add piece.size * piece.size

size of "piece" in data: 8 + (SS * ZZ * ZZ)
size of "state" in data: 11

mode m = data[0]
color c = data[1..2]
states s = data[3..4]
size z = data[5..6]
matrix m = data[7..(states * size * size)]

x = state[0..2]
y = state[3..5]
r = state[6..7]
mode-override v = state[8]
color-override o = state[9..10]

spawn x = 5 - (ZZ/2) + (ZZ%2)
note: integer division in C returns the integer part of the division result (e.g. 3/2 = 1), hence the +(ZZ%2)



 char* test = "00604040000111100000000001000100010001000000000111100000100010001000100";
    char get[3];
    memset(get, '\0', sizeof(get));
    char* ptr;
    strncpy(get, test + 5, 2);
    int end = (int)strtol(get, &ptr, 10);
    printf("%i\n",end);

//prints "4"
